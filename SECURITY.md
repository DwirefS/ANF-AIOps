## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure practices:

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

### Reporting Process

1. **Email**: Send details to security@your-org.com
2. **Encryption**: Use our PGP key (available at [keys.your-org.com](https://keys.your-org.com))
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution Timeline**: Based on severity
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 14 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: 90 days

## Security Measures

### Architecture Security

- **Zero Trust Model**: Never trust, always verify
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary permissions
- **Secure by Default**: Security enabled out of the box

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 with Azure Key Vault
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 minimum
- **Key Management**: HSM-backed key storage
- **Data Classification**: Automatic sensitivity labeling

### Access Control

- **Azure AD Integration**: Centralized identity management
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for all admin operations
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permission model
- **Just-In-Time Access**: Temporary elevated privileges

### Network Security

- **Private Endpoints**: No public internet exposure
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolated VNets per environment
- **WAF Protection**: Azure Application Gateway with WAF
- **DDoS Protection**: Azure DDoS Protection Standard

### Application Security

- **Input Validation**: All inputs sanitized
- **Parameterized Queries**: Prevent SQL injection
- **Security Headers**: Proper security headers configured
- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and DoS

### Monitoring & Detection

- **Azure Sentinel**: AI-powered SIEM
- **Threat Detection**: Real-time threat monitoring
- **Anomaly Detection**: ML-based behavior analysis
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity logging

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Code Reviews**: Security-focused peer reviews
2. **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Vulnerable package detection
4. **Secret Management**: Never commit secrets

### For Operators

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep all components patched
2. **Access Reviews**: Quarterly permission audits
3. **Incident Response**: Follow IR procedures
4. **Backup Testing**: Regular recovery drills

### For Users

1. **Strong Authentication**: Use MFA always
2. **Least Privilege**: Request minimal permissions
3. **Report Suspicious Activity**: Immediate reporting
4. **Security Training**: Complete required training

## Compliance

This solution is designed to meet:

- **SOC 2 Type II**
- **ISO 27001/27002**
